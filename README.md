## Problem 4-0: Sorting Algorithm

Choose one of the sorting algorithms below. Mild algorithms should be review from CS50; spicy algorithms should be new! For your algorithm...

* Research it!
* Provide the **Java code**. There is no need to write the algorithm from scratch -- you may find code on the internet and cite it.
* Write a **paragraph** walking through each line of code and how it works to demonstrate your understanding of the algorithm.

Mild:
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort

Spicy:
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort

**Challenge**: 

(This problem will be graded on scope, correctness, and style.)

## Problem 4-1: Fibonacci

**Part 1:** Write a method called `fibonacci` that takes in an integer as an argument and recursively calculates that number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, `fibonacci(6)` should return 8, the sixth number in the Fibonacci sequence. As it is recursive, your method should have a base case and a recursive case.

(This is a common recursive practice problem, so you are on your honor not to look up the code and instead write the method yourself in order to learn more about recursion!)

**Part 2:** Write a stack trace of the recursive method calls for `fibonacci(5)` in the same style as the stack trace for the [Factorial Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_dy_8VEPKYWQjr-xgC0_s8trAqc43IjbKFQOTBW_Hoo/).
